# Complex Querying
1. start small: write a simple query, then add to it and compare the before and after results
2. start with the correct syntax: make sure you write the outline for your query to ensure, if something goes wrong, it's not syntax related
3. KISS: if your approach looks very large and complex, see if you can approach the problem by using another concept or combination of clauses. There's more than one way to get to a solution!
